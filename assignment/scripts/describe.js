// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we make a vaiable called name and set its value to be 'Dane'
// we then check if the name we created is 'Mary', if it was 'Mary' we would log to the console 'Hi, Mary!'
// Since the variable is not 'Mary' we instead move to the the next phrase which will apply to everyone except 'Mary'
//This other phrase will log to the console 'How do you do?'

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create a variable named secret and do not give it a value
// We create another variable named code and give it the value of 123
// We check if the value assigned to code is equal to 123, if it is then we change the value of secret to be 'super' and we double the value of code to 246.
//We then check if the value of code is over 250, as it is not the value of secret stays 'super' and we can log 'super' to the console.

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We define three variables 1. isStudent is true 2. age is 34 3. zip is 55407
// We then check if this is indeed a student AND if that students zip is higher than 80000,
// it is not so we move on to the next check of if they are a student OR they are under the age of 30, also not true, moving onto the next check which does hold true.
//This will log to the console 'Welcome to Prime!

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
